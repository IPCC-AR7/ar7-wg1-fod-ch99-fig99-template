# Code directory

This is where you should store the code used to analyse input data and create the data for the figure, if any. If no such 
code is necessary, simply remove this directory. 

This code won't be included in the data archives, but you may want to ask your co-authors for reviews and comments. 
Feel free to include notebooks or scripts in whatever language makes sense for your work.

Ideally you'd include enough instructions and documentations for your work to be reproducible by others, but this is 
not a strict requirement for AR7.
